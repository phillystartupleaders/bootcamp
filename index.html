    <p>Ideation and vision is not just about saying you have a great idea, it is about knowing you have a great idea!  But how?</p>
    <p>Startup ideas are educated guesses. But what if your guess is wrong?  We have all been there. You must teach yourself to think
      big and often. And you must teach yourself to be intellectually honest about the merits and market potential of each
      idea before you invest weeks, months, or years in pursing it.</p>
    <p>In this segment, Phil Moyer, managing director of Safeguard Scientific, a Philadelphia based venture capital firm
      that has invested in several local Philly startups, provides his insights and strategy for finding and assessing ideas.
      Phil brings decades of experience as a software developer, founder, CEO and venture capitalist to the question of Ideation and Vision.</p>
    <p>In this segment, you will learn a framework for coming up with and assessing your idea; the foundation of all that is to come.</p>

        "Almost all failed startups had products. What they didn't have are enough customers."

        <cite>Traction Book</cite>
      </blockquote>

      <p>While there are many methodologies for product development, there are none that explicitly deal with
        getting
        traction. After interviewing over forty successful founders, Gabriel Weinberg recognized patterns and
        synthesized them into a framework for getting traction he calls "Bullseye." Bullseye is the main thesis of
        his new book <a href="http://tractionbook.com">"Traction."</a></p>

      <p>Bullseye was constructed on the premise that startups mainly use one traction channel at a time to lead
        their growth. These channels usually dry up leading the company to return to the drawing board to find their
        next big ride; however, individuals tend to be biased for or against certain channels given previous
        experience. Bullseye counters this instinct by systematically leading founders to think about all available
        avenues. Steps include:</p>

      <ul class="disc">
        <li>Brainstorming</li>
        <li>Ranking</li>
        <li>Prioritizing</li>
        <li>Testing</li>
        <li>Focusing</li>

      <ul class="disc assignment">
        <li>In this assignment, you will learn how to think about getting traction. One of the biggest mistakes
          entrepreneurs make is treat traction as an after thought. This should be thought out before a product is
          built and should be continuously implemented and tested as the product is built.
        </li>
        <li>Entrepreneurs are also often biased towards verticals they already know about. You only need one to work
          at a time so don’t cut yourself short by only thinking about the 2&ndash;3 that feel most comfortable to
          you.
          One of the other 16 might hold the key.

          <ul class="lower-alpha">
            <li>
              This number should mean you are financially stable. To be stable, this means you have enough revenue
              to cover costs for the team or enough traction to raise money.
              <ul class="lower-roman">
                <li>Costs for team is basic living costs and company costs.</li>
                <li>Number of users to raise money, look at the market. Look at other companies in your market and
                  see how much users they had or guess.

              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Complete the Brainstorm tab in the spreadsheet to the best of your knowledge.
          <ul class="lower-alpha">
            <li>Make sure you brainstorm each vertical. Search DuckDuckGo ;) about anything you don’t know.</li>
            <li>These are educated guesses just to get started. Once again, search for anything you don’t know
              anything about.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Comparing to your traction goal, rank each vertical into your inner circle, promising, and long shots in
          the Rank tab in the spreadsheet. Just name the verticals.
        </li>
        <li>Prioritize the Rank sheet into your Prioritize tab. Place your top three verticals into your inner
          circle. Your next into promising. And everything else into Long shots.
        </li>
        <li>Place your Inner circle into your Test tab. Although the Test tab is very similar to the Brainstorm tab,
          the Test tab nails down the specifics. No more educated guesses.
          <ul class="lower-alpha">
            <li>Run one set of tests for your top 3.</li>
            <li>If you don’t have a product, get clever. A classic setup is to start a <a

      <h6 style="color: gray;">Follow the attached assignment to identify and validate the assumptions of your product. Then run one or more experiments to lean if any of your risk factors are problematic and, if so, what you need to do to modify the idea to avoid them. For all those assumptions that you've validated (and de-risked), how does that reinforce and strengthen your original idea? Develop a 5-slide presentation to recap your product development journey.  </6>

          <p>By this point in the Bootcamp, our theme is becoming very clear: data leads decision making!
            Mapping the Product is our first venture towards creating a "real" product. The goal of this segment is
            to learn to translate your idea and market feedback gathered so far into an product that will provide just
            the essential features, a true MVP, necessary to gather a new set of data-points that brings us one step closer
            to a market validated product.</p>

      <p> THE GOAL OF THIS SEGMENT IS TO DESIGN A MEANS OF GATHERING THE DATA POINTS THAT WILL GUIDE US TOWARDS VALIDATION.</P>
      <p class="italic bold ">Instructions:</p>
      <p>Implement the “Mapping the Product” framework on two core functions of your product.  As you decide which are the core functions and map these functions into a product function, you should be constantly focused on solely on delivering the solution to your customer’s problem that you have been refining up to now.</p>

      <ol class="disc assignment">
        <li><b>Define</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Define your problem & customer in no more than three sentences. 
              <ul>
                <li>Exclude anything that doesn’t directly deliver your solution.</li>
                <li>(exclude basic functionalities like authentication, settings, etc for this exercise unless they are core to solution.)

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>What <b>data points</b> does my MVP need to provide?  
              <ul>
                <li>Is it a daily usage rate? signup rate?</li>
                <li>Why this metric?</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Define what <b>validation</b> will look like? 
              <ul>
                <li>This should include some customer metric of degree to which your solution solves the problem.</li>
                <li>Define a minimum of three metrics that together or individually indicate validation.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Define the <b>Field Test</b> - the optimal process for getting validation for your product.
              <ul>
                <li>What interview/demo process & series of interview questions will  best allow for testing?</li>

              <ul>
                <li>**This should be no more than wireframe** -  the point here is UX over graphic design.</li>

                <li>What is the <b>most important action</b> we want the user to take?</li>

            <li>Does your function map provide an opportunity to get each point of validation needed?  Document a complete tear down of what you have created so far.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Revise</b> - loop back with new perspective (tear down) and proceed again.

          <p class="bold">Can your business make money and become profitable?</p>

          <p>This is perhaps the most critically important question an entrepreneur must ask.
            There are ways to become profitable, just like there are ways to maximize profits. A
            business model with its related financial plan describes how an organization creates,
            delivers and captures value. This, in turn, drives your cash-flow.
            Ultimately, building and relying on a good business model is one of the keys to the
            success of any venture. In this session, you will build the first iteration of your business model and
            related financial model.</p>

          <p class="bold">Steps</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Understanding a business model and completing each of the nine building blocks for your business</li>
            <li>Using the business model canvas, you will build your first iteration and complete your first financial
              model
            </li>
            <li>Run through the checklist for a crystal clear business model</li>
          </ul>

          <p>A business-modelling workshop generally lasts three to five days. Since this is a one day workshop, follow up
          office hours will be available via Walnut Street Labs in order to help you complete the creation of your
          business model.</p>

          <br>

          <p class="italic">Assignment:</p>

         <p> In this assignment you will use the customer development process to analyze and validate your
          business model/financial model.</p>

          <p>Note: One of the best ways to become fluent in validated business models is to analyze the
          patterns established by competitors and other businesses already succeeding in the market.</p>

          <p class="italic">Instructions:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Select a successful company that has a business model similar to the one you feel best
              matches your own.  Analyze its business model and complete the business model canvas
              for this business, if possible look at their financial models and their metrics.</li>
            <li>Re-analyze your own startup idea/model and highlight the riskiest or untested
              assumptions in your model.</li>
            <li>Customer development is critical. The model you create in the class is a starting point.
              The goal of this step is to get out of the building to validate and evolve the model,
              updating it with your validated customer feedback.</li>
            <li>Prepare your presentation</li>
          </ol>

          <p class="italic">Presentation Format</p>

          <ul>
            <li>In no more than 5 slides, pitch the story of your business model and summarize any lessons
              learned from customer development/validation process.</li>
            <li>The final slide should be devoted to your riskiest assumptions.</li>
            <li>You will have 5 minutes to present your slide deck and 5 minutes for critique and feedback
              from Joanne &amp; Chris.</li>

      <h2 class="heading">FAQ</h2>

      <p class="faq-heading">That all?</p>

      <p>Of course not. Participants will be required to complete reading assignments before each talk. After the talk,
        framework specific assignments will be given. Individuals &amp; teams will have to execute the frameworks on their
        own ideas over the next week or two.</p>

      <p class="faq-heading">Schedule?</p>

      <p>Starting Sept. 10th, the bootcamp will meet once a week someday between Monday and Friday at 6:30 pm. Each
        session will last approximately 2-3 hours, depending on the need. There will be 9 sessions covering the 6
        segments.</p>

      <p class="faq-heading">Can I get feedback?</p>

      <p>Each segment is two weeks long. The second session is time allotted for individuals to showcase their work.
        They will be critiqued and given feedback by leaders and employees of local startups.</p>

      <p class="faq-heading">Who is it for?</p>

      <p>You can be a student, an employee of a startup, or already a founder. You can have an idea or not. Doesn’t
        matter. Ambition and self-drive is what we are looking for.
        Commitment? Full participation in the sessions and assignments is required. If you miss an event, you must show
        that you have done the work on your own.</p>

      <p class="faq-heading">What you will get out of it?</p>
