          <p>So whats it all about? This startup game… We all know that startups are about building successful
            companies. But that is only one small piece of it. They are about building hyper-growth companies.
            Companies whose trajectory, after initial traction aims more and more upwards.</p>

          <p>Session 1 will focus on the big picture, making the experience tangible as Rick Nucci leads off the
            BootCamp with the story of Boomi. Boomi started in 2000 and went through many good days and bad before
            getting to their breakout moment and ultimate acquisition by Dell in 2010. Nucci will use the Boomi
            story to outline some of his favorite startup mistakes, and share the key factors that resulted in
            Boomi’s ultimate success; the lessons that now guide his approach to the startup process.</p>

      Startup ideas are educated guesses. But what if your guess is wrong? Don't worry. We have all been there.
      You must teach yourself to think big and often. Curalate's founding team knows this better than anyone.
      Curalate originally started as Storably - an Airbnb for storage. They were venture backed by some of the
      best investors. They had a killer team. Yet, there was no growth. (Remember, Startup = Growth!). Since their
      investors believed in them, they were told they had one month to come up with a new idea. Fast forwarding,
      Curalate is one of the fastest growing companies in Philadelphia. They have raised over $12 million in
      funding from investors such us as First Round Capital and NEA.</p>

    <p>In this session, Curalate will ask you to take a step back and really force yourself to think big before
      stepping back in. They will provide the framework they came up with that led them to Curalate.

        "Almost all failed startups had products. What they didn't have are enough customers."

        <cite>Traction Book</cite>
      </blockquote>

      <p>While there are many methodologies for product development, there are none that explicitly deal with
        getting
        traction. After interviewing over forty successful founders, Gabriel Weinberg recognized patterns and
        synthesized them into a framework for getting traction he calls "Bullseye." Bullseye is the main thesis of
        his new book <a href="http://tractionbook.com">"Traction."</a></p>

      <p>Bullseye was constructed on the premise that startups mainly use one traction channel at a time to lead
        their growth. These channels usually dry up leading the company to return to the drawing board to find their
        next big ride; however, individuals tend to be biased for or against certain channels given previous
        experience. Bullseye counters this instinct by systematically leading founders to think about all available
        avenues. Steps include:</p>

      <ul class="disc">
        <li>Brainstorming</li>
        <li>Ranking</li>
        <li>Prioritizing</li>

      <h5 class="text-center">Bullseye</h5>

      <p class="italic">Assignment:</p>
      <ul class="disc assignment">
        <li>In this assignment, you will learn how to think about getting traction. One of the biggest mistakes
          entrepreneurs make is treat traction as an after thought. This should be thought out before a product is
          built and should be continuously implemented and tested as the product is built.
        </li>
        <li>Entrepreneurs are also often biased towards verticals they already know about. You only need one to work
          at a time so don’t cut yourself short by only thinking about the 2&ndash;3 that feel most comfortable to
          you.
          One of the other 16 might hold the key.

      <p class="italic">Instructions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Decide your traction goal. THIS IS KEY!!!!
          <ul class="lower-alpha">
            <li>
              This number should mean you are financially stable. To be stable, this means you have enough revenue
              to cover costs for the team or enough traction to raise money.
              <ul class="lower-roman">
                <li>Costs for team is basic living costs and company costs.</li>
                <li>Number of users to raise money, look at the market. Look at other companies in your market and
                  see how much users they had or guess.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Complete the Brainstorm tab in the spreadsheet to the best of your knowledge.
          <ul class="lower-alpha">
            <li>Make sure you brainstorm each vertical. Search DuckDuckGo ;) about anything you don’t know.</li>
            <li>These are educated guesses just to get started. Once again, search for anything you don’t know
              anything about.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Comparing to your traction goal, rank each vertical into your inner circle, promising, and long shots in
          the Rank tab in the spreadsheet. Just name the verticals.
        </li>
        <li>Prioritize the Rank sheet into your Prioritize tab. Place your top three verticals into your inner
          circle. Your next into promising. And everything else into Long shots.
        </li>
        <li>Place your Inner circle into your Test tab. Although the Test tab is very similar to the Brainstorm tab,
          the Test tab nails down the specifics. No more educated guesses.
          <ul class="lower-alpha">
            <li>Run one set of tests for your top 3.</li>
            <li>If you don’t have a product, get clever. A classic setup is to start a <a
              href="http://launchrock.co/">LaunchRock</a> page and collect
              emails via mailchimp. All free. But once again get clever.
            </li>
            <li>Test all three channels in parallel to find the best.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Now it’s time to focus. Once you have found what works the best. It’s time to optimize.</li>

        Lean thinking defines value as providing benefit to the customer; anything else is waste.
        <cite>Eric Ries, Author of The Lean Startup</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Lean Thinking is all about getting to the answers that matter as efficiently as possible. It is a frame of
        mind that with practice will change every piece of your process, but it excels at steering you towards the
        right product.
      </p>

      <p>Session 3 & 4 focus on the lean approach used by Bob Moore and Jake Stein as they built RJMetrics from its
        initial conception and two guys in an attic to their first customer, their first product and on to a company
        of 70 employees in the center of Philadelphia. Their path highlights a framework that places emphasis on
        market validation and product market fit before the product is event built.

      <h3>Session 2</h3>
      <h4>Tristan Handy</h4>
      <em>VP of Marketing</em>

      <p>Tristan has been analyzing data since he was 17, working in finance, consulting, and marketing. Recently,
        he’s used data to grow SaaS companies in executive roles at RJMetrics, Squarespace, and Argyle Social.

      <p>
        After graduating high school when she was 16, Anita went to NYU and by 18, had a degree in Politics and a
        minor in Mathematics. This gave her plenty of time in life to do worthwhile things like foster her loves for
        eating desserts, working out, watching movies (which she has very low standards for), and reading. After
        fighting urban blight, improving immigrant rights, and raising the bar on NYC living by working for
        then-Mayor Rudy Giuliani, she decided campaigns weren't her thing and got her Master's in Computer Science
        from Stanford. Along the way, she's run product, marketing, analytics and e-commerce at a variety of
        companies including Ingenio (bought by AT&T YellowPages), Nutrisystem, and Sepiida (which she founded and
        was acquired by Delphic Digital). In her spare time, she tries to do a good job as a wife and mother to her
        17 month old daughter.

            "Design is a funny word. Some people think design means how it looks. But of course, if you dig deeper, it's

          <p>
            Ok, you have iterated your way to a core idea that you have now validated and potentially sold to the
            market.
            Now it is time to turn that idea into a real product.

            The Mapping the Product segment will train you on how to take an idea and turn it into a product map. The
            map is akin to a set of blue prints that attempts to bridge the gap between user and developer while
            remaining understandable and complete for both. In the opening session, Chris Cera and the Arcweb team share
            their own process that they have gleaned from guiding their many clients from the earliest ideas through to
            a finished working product. Steps include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Distilling the core purpose & experience</li>
            <li>Storyboarding the UX</li>
            <li>Prioritizing the elements of each screen</li>
            <li>Visualization - Design & flow</li>

          <p class="bold">Can your business make money and become profitable?</p>

          <p>This is perhaps the most critically important question an entrepreneur must ask.
            There are ways to become profitable, just like there are ways to maximize profits. A
            business model with its related financial plan describes how an organization creates,
            delivers and captures value. This, in turn, drives your cash-flow.
            Ultimately, building and relying on a good business model is one of the keys to the
            success of any venture. In this session, you will build the first iteration of your business model and
            related financial model.</p>

          <p class="bold">Steps</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Understanding a business model and completing each of the nine building blocks for your business</li>
            <li>Using the business model canvas, you will build your first iteration and complete your first financial
              model
            </li>
            <li>Run through the checklist for a crystal clear business model</li>
          </ul>

          <p>A business-modelling workshop generally lasts three to five days. Since this is a one day workshop, follow up
          office hours will be available via Walnut Street Labs in order to help you complete the creation of your
          business model.</p>

          <p class="bold text-center">Due Date: 12/30 by Midnight</p>

          <p class="italic">Assignment:</p>

         <p> In this assignment you will use the customer development process to analyze and validate your
          business model/financial model.</p>

          <p>Note: One of the best ways to become fluent in validated business models is to analyze the
          patterns established by competitors and other businesses already succeeding in the market.</p>

          <p class="italic">Instructions:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Select a successful company that has a business model similar to the one you feel best
              matches your own.  Analyze its business model and complete the business model canvas
              for this business, if possible look at their financial models and their metrics.</li>
            <li>Re-analyze your own startup idea/model and highlight the riskiest or untested
              assumptions in your model.</li>
            <li>Customer development is critical. The model you create in the class is a starting point.
              The goal of this step is to get out of the building to validate and evolve the model,
              updating it with your validated customer feedback.</li>
            <li>Prepare your presentation</li>
          </ol>

          <p class="italic">Presentation Format</p>

          <ul>
            <li>In no more than 5 slides, pitch the story of your business model and summarize any lessons
              learned from customer development/validation process.</li>
            <li>The final slide should be devoted to your riskiest assumptions.</li>
            <li>You will have 5 minutes to present your slide deck and 5 minutes for critique and feedback
              from Joanne & Chris.</li>

      <h2 class="heading">FAQ</h2>

      <p class="faq-heading">That all?</p>

      <p>Of course not. Participants will be required to complete reading assignments before each talk. After the talk,
        framework specific assignments will be given. Individuals & teams will have to execute the frameworks on their
        own ideas over the next week or two.</p>

      <p class="faq-heading">Schedule?</p>

      <p>Starting Sept. 15th, the bootcamp will meet once a week someday between Monday and Friday at 6:30 pm. Each
        session will last approximately 2-3 hours, depending the need. There will be 9 sessions covering the 6
        segments.</p>

      <p class="faq-heading">Can I get feedback?</p>

      <p>Each segment is two weeks long. The second session is time allotted for individuals to showcase their work.
        They will be critiqued and given feedback by leaders and employees of local startups.</p>

      <p class="faq-heading">Who is it for?</p>

      <p>You can be a student, an employee of a startup, or already a founder. You can have an idea or not. Doesn’t
        matter. Ambition and self-drive is what we are looking for.
        Commitment? Full participation in the sessions and assignments is required. If you miss an event, you must show
        that you have done the work on your own.</p>

      <p class="faq-heading">What you will get out of it?</p>

      <p>The bootcamp is designed to shape you as a founder and give you some tested tools for tackling the perennial
        challenges of a startup.</p>

      <p class="faq-heading">Cost?</p>

      <p>Free; however, we will charge you $50 upfront so you personally invest in yourself and the community. If you
        complete the bootcamp, you will get your money back. If you can’t afford the deposit, contact us:
