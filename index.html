And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle."

          <p>Ideation and vision isn’t just about saying you have a great idea; it’s about knowing you have a great idea! But how do you know? Startup ideas are educated guesses. But what if your guess is wrong? You must teach yourself to think big and often. And you must teach yourself to be intellectually honest about the merits and market potential of each idea before you invest weeks, months, or years pursuing it. In this segment you will learn a framework for brainstorming and assessing your idea, as well as performing intelligent market research, to set the stage for all that is to come.</p>

          <p>Lean thinking is a method for developing businesses and products first proposed in 2008 by Eric Ries. Based on his previous experience working in several U.S. startups, Ries claims that startups can shorten their product development cycles by adopting a combination of business-hypothesis-driven experimentation, iterative product releases, and what he calls validated learning. Ries' overall claim is that if startups invest their time into iteratively building products or services to meet the needs of early customers, they can reduce the market risks and sidestep the need for large amounts of initial project funding and expensive product launches and failures. Originally developed with high-tech companies in mind, the lean thinking philosophy has since been expanded to apply to any individual, team, or company looking to introduce new products or services into the market.</p>

          <p>While there are many methodologies for product development, none explicitly deal with gaining traction. After interviewing over forty successful founders, Gabriel Weinberg recognized patterns and synthesized them into a framework for getting traction he calls "Bullseye." Bullseye is the main thesis of his book Traction and was constructed on the premise that startups mainly use one traction channel at a time to lead their growth. These channels usually dry up, leading the company to return to the drawing board to find their next big ride. However, individuals tend to be biased for or against certain channels given previous experience. Bullseye counters this instinct by systematically leading founders to think about all available avenues.</p>

          <p>By this point in the bootcamp our theme is becoming very clear: data leads decision making! Mapping the Product is our first venture towards creating a "real" product. The goal of this segment is to learn to translate your idea and the market feedback you’ve gathered into a product that will provide just the essential features, a true MVP (minimum viable product), necessary to gather a new set of data points that will bring us closer to a market validated product. In this segment you will learn an iterative process for moving efficiently from idea to validated product. Topics include test-driven design, high-level UI/UX, prototyping tools, and product design.</p>

          <p>Can your business make money and become profitable? This is perhaps the most critically important question an entrepreneur must ask. There are strategies and tactics to become profitable, just like there are strategies and tactics to maximize profits. A business model with its related financial plan describes how an organization creates, delivers and captures value. This, in turn, drives your cash flow. Ultimately, building and relying on a good business model is one of the keys to the success of any venture. In this session, you will build the first iteration of your business model and related financial model. You will understand a business model and complete each of the nine building blocks for your business, build your first iteration and complete your first financial model using the business model canvas, and run through the checklist for a crystal clear business model.</p>
